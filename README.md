# NLP- Sentiment Analysis of Airline tweets

Millions rely on airlines to get to their destination each day. There are many airlines a consumer can choose from. However, if a consumer has a bad experience with an airline, this might result in the loss of customers and a bad reputation. Readers' Digest highlights that some causes of poor rep include delays, cancellations, and poor customer service. I seek to understand further the general public opinion of some of the top U.S. airlines with the use of text mining and sentiment analysis. The dataset comes from Kaggle.com. The original source is from Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library. 

According to a source, there are 3.48 billion users of social media. Social media is known for being a place where they express their feelings or views. It is also useful from a business perspective, providing insightful information about consumers and their opinions of brands. Airlines could benefit from more social media analytics and target the high pain issues of their passengers.  The dataset contains scraped user posts from the social media platform Twitter. Tweets are in the form of 140 character text. A disadvantage of using Twitter data is that there is often a lack of grammatical structure and proper spelling. Additionally, there is no exact way to detect sarcasm.
